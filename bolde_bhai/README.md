- A voice recorder app that supports android and ios
- Works by storing voice recordings to temporary storage
- Plays and records using the audio_waveforms packages from pub.dev



## TODO

- Display only .aac files from temporary storage 
- Use the record package from pub.dev to listen to amplitude of recorded sound and plot waveforms on web and windows
- Don't save to file storage if the recordings are empty
- The waveform doesn't map to the sound perfectly so the duration of the wave animation will have to be adjusted
